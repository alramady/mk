# Security & Privacy
> Last updated: 2026-02-27

This article outlines the security and privacy policies at Monthly Key. All staff members are required to adhere to these guidelines to protect our customers, our partners, and our company.

## Data Classification

To ensure clarity, we classify data into three categories. Understanding these categories is the first step in handling data responsibly.

| Data Category | Description | Sharing Policy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Public** | Information that is already public knowledge and presents no risk if disclosed. | Can be shared freely. |
| **Internal** | Information related to the internal operations of Monthly Key. While not sensitive, it is not intended for public dissemination. | Can be shared with other Monthly Key employees. Do not share externally. |
| **Confidential** | Sensitive information that could cause harm to individuals or the company if disclosed. This includes customer data, financial information, and system credentials. | **Strictly confidential.** Access and sharing are restricted to authorized personnel on a need-to-know basis. |

## Customer Data Protection

Protecting our customers' data is our highest priority. The following rules apply to all customer information:

- **Do Not Share Customer PII:** Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, and National IDs must never be shared with anyone outside of Monthly Key. Internally, PII should only be accessed for legitimate business purposes.
- **Payment Information:** Customer payment details (credit card numbers, mada card details) are processed securely by Moyasar. Staff cannot access or view full payment details. Never ask a customer to send payment information via insecure channels like chat or email.
- **Booking Details:** Booking information is confidential and should only be discussed with the customer who made the booking.

## API Keys and Credentials

API keys and system credentials are the keys to our kingdom. They must be protected with the utmost care.

### Moyasar API Keys

- **Access:** Only `admin` and `finance` roles have access to Moyasar API keys.
- **Sharing:** Never share Moyasar API keys. They should not be sent via email, chat, or any other messaging system.
- **Storage:** API keys should not be stored in plain text on your computer.

### Beds24 Credentials

- **Access:** `admin` and `ops` roles have access to Beds24 credentials.
- **Sharing:** Do not share your Beds24 login details with anyone. Each authorized user has their own account.
- **Password Policy:** Use a strong, unique password for your Beds24 account and enable two-factor authentication if available.

## FAQ

**Q1: A customer is asking for their booking details to be sent to them via WhatsApp. Can I do this?**

A1: No. You should direct the customer to log in to their account on the Monthly Key platform to view their booking details. Do not send confidential information over insecure channels.

**Q2: I need to test the payment system. Can I use a real customer's credit card details?**

A2: Absolutely not. Never use real customer data for testing. The development team will provide test card numbers for this purpose.

**Q3: My colleague from the support team is asking for the Beds24 password. What should I do?**

A3: Do not share your password. If your colleague needs access to Beds24, they should request it through their manager. Access is granted based on job roles and responsibilities.

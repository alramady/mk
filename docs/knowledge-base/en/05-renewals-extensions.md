# Renewals & Extensions
> Last updated: 2026-02-27

This article outlines the process for handling booking renewals and extensions for guests of "Monthly Key". It covers eligibility, the request and approval workflow, and special considerations for units managed through Beds24.

## Eligibility for Renewal

Only bookings with a duration of one month are eligible for a single extension. Guests who have booked for longer periods or who have already received an extension are not eligible for further renewals through the standard process.

| Booking Duration | Eligible for Extension? | Number of Extensions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 Month | Yes | 1 |
| > 1 Month | No | 0 |
| Already Extended | No | 0 |

## Renewal Workflow

The renewal process is designed to be straightforward while ensuring that all necessary checks and approvals are completed. The workflow involves the support, operations, and sometimes the admin team.

1.  **Request:** The guest submits a renewal request to the **support** team.
2.  **Verification:** The **support** team verifies the eligibility of the booking for renewal.
3.  **Approval:**
    *   For standard units, the **ops** team approves the renewal.
    *   For Beds24-controlled units, the request is forwarded to the **admin** team for approval.
4.  **Confirmation:** Once approved, the guest is notified, and the booking is updated in the system.

## Beds24-Controlled Units

Units that are mapped to Beds24 require special handling to avoid conflicts with the channel manager. The system **never** writes booking information directly to Beds24; all changes for these units must be managed carefully.

> **Important:** For any renewal or extension of a Beds24-controlled unit, an **admin** must approve the change. A clear "change note" must be added to the booking record, detailing the nature of the extension and the approval received.

For more details on unit management, please see [Buildings & Units](../en/02-buildings-units.md).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Processing a Standard Renewal

1.  **Receive Request:** A guest contacts the **support** team to request a renewal.
2.  **Check Eligibility:** The **support** team member locates the booking in the system and confirms it is a 1-month booking that has not been previously extended.
3.  **Forward to Ops:** The request is forwarded to the **ops** team for processing.
4.  **Ops Approval:** The **ops** team reviews the unit's availability and approves the renewal.
5.  **Update Booking:** The booking is extended in the system, and a payment request for the new period is generated. For more information on payments, refer to the [Payments](../en/03-payments.md) article.

### Processing a Beds24-Controlled Renewal

1.  **Receive Request:** A guest contacts the **support** team.
2.  **Check Eligibility & Unit Type:** The **support** team verifies eligibility and identifies the unit as being Beds24-controlled.
3.  **Forward to Admin:** The request is escalated to the **admin** team for approval.
4.  **Admin Approval & Change Note:** The **admin** reviews the request. If approved, they will add a "change note" to the booking (e.g., "Approved for 1-month extension by [Admin Name] on YYYY-MM-DD").
5.  **Ops Execution:** The **ops** team then extends the booking in the local system, ensuring the change note is present.

## FAQ

**Q1: What if a guest wants to extend for more than one month?**

> A single extension is for one additional month. If a guest wishes to stay longer, they should be advised to make a new booking. This ensures that unit availability is managed correctly, especially for Beds24-controlled units.

**Q2: What happens if a renewal request for a Beds24 unit is not approved by the admin?**

> If the admin denies the renewal request, the **support** team must inform the guest that the extension is not possible and that they will need to check out at the end of their current booking period. The reason for the denial should be clearly communicated if appropriate (e.g., owner block, upcoming maintenance).

**Q3: Can a guest renew if their unit is scheduled for maintenance?**

> No. If a unit has a `MAINTENANCE` status for the requested extension period, the renewal cannot be processed. The guest may be offered an alternative unit if one is available.

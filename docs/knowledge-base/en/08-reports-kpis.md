## Understanding Your Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Below are the definitions and calculation methods for the primary KPIs used at Monthly Key.

### Occupancy %

**Occupancy Percentage** is the single most important metric for understanding how effectively we are utilizing our properties. It is the percentage of occupied units out of the total available units over a specific period.

- **Formula**: `(Number of Occupied Units / Total Number of Available Units) * 100`
- **Example**: If we have 200 available units and 150 are occupied, the occupancy rate is 75%.
- **Goal**: To maintain a consistently high occupancy rate, ideally above 90%.

### PAR (Price Per Available Room)

**Price Per Available Room** helps us understand the average revenue potential of our units, regardless of whether they are occupied or not. It is a useful metric for pricing strategies.

- **Formula**: `Total Unit Revenue / Total Number of Available Units`
- **Note**: This is different from Average Daily Rate (ADR), which is calculated only for occupied rooms.

### Collected YTD (Collected Year-to-Date)

**Collected Year-to-Date** is a straightforward financial metric that shows the total revenue collected from the beginning of the calendar year to the current date. This figure includes all payments that have a `PAID` status in the ledger.

- **Source**: Ledger module, filtered for `PAID` status.
- **Importance**: Crucial for financial planning, budgeting, and performance tracking against annual targets.

### EAR (Effective Annual Rate)

**Effective Annual Rate** represents the annualized revenue from a single unit, taking into account its monthly rate and any periods of vacancy. It helps in evaluating the long-term value of individual units.

- **Formula**: `(Total Annual Revenue for a Unit / 365) * Number of Occupied Days`
- **Use Case**: Comparing the profitability of different units or buildings.

### RevPAU (Revenue Per Available Unit)

**Revenue Per Available Unit** is a powerful metric that combines occupancy and pricing into a single number. It shows the average revenue generated by each available unit.

- **Formula**: `Total Revenue / Total Number of Available Units`
- **Significance**: A rising RevPAU indicates a healthy combination of strong occupancy and effective pricing.

## How to Read the Dashboard

Follow these steps to effectively analyze the information presented on the dashboard.

1.  **Start with the KPI Summary**: Get a quick pulse check of the business. Are Occupancy and Collected YTD meeting targets?
2.  **Analyze the Occupancy Trend**: Look at the 30-day occupancy chart. Are there any noticeable dips or spikes? A downward trend may require an investigation into pricing, marketing, or unit availability.
3.  **Review Revenue Metrics**: In the Revenue Report section, check the EAR and RevPAU. If RevPAU is low despite high occupancy, it might indicate that our pricing is too low.
4.  **Monitor Unit Status**: The Unit Status Overview helps the operations team to quickly see how many units are offline for maintenance or other reasons. A high number of `MAINTENANCE` or `BLOCKED` units will directly impact occupancy and revenue.
5.  **Check Recent Bookings**: The support and ops teams should monitor the recent bookings feed to stay aware of new arrivals and special requests.

## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

**1. Why is the Occupancy rate on the dashboard different from what I see in Beds24?**

The dashboard shows the occupancy for all Monthly Key units, including those not mapped to Beds24. Beds24 will only show data for the units synced with its platform. Our dashboard provides the complete picture.

**2. How often are the KPIs on the dashboard updated?**

All KPIs and data on the dashboard are updated in near real-time. Financial data like 'Collected YTD' is updated as soon as a payment is confirmed and the ledger status changes to `PAID`.

**3. Can I see historical KPI data?**

The main dashboard focuses on current and recent performance. For detailed historical analysis, you can use the 'Reports' section in the main menu to generate custom reports for specific date ranges.

**4. What does it mean if a booking source is 'UNKNOWN'?**

This indicates a booking that has not been correctly attributed to either a `BEDS24` or `LOCAL` source. This is rare and should be flagged to the admin team for investigation. It usually points to a temporary data sync issue.

**5. Who has access to the full financial data like Collected YTD?**

Access to sensitive financial data is role-based. Only users with `Admin` and `Finance` roles can view detailed financial reports and KPIs like Collected YTD.

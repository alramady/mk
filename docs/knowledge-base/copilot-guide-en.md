# Copilot User Guide

> Last updated: 2026-02-27

## What is the Copilot?

The Copilot is an internal AI-powered assistant designed to help **Monthly Key** staff answer questions about the system and operations. The Copilot uses **only the Knowledge Base** as its information source, ensuring answers are accurate and aligned with current policies.

## How to Use

### Accessing the Copilot

Access the Copilot from the Admin Dashboard via the **AI Copilot** menu item in the sidebar, or navigate directly to `/admin/copilot`.

### Asking Questions

You can ask questions in **Arabic** or **English**. The Copilot understands both languages and responds in the same language as your question.

**Example Questions:**

| Question | Topic |
|----------|-------|
| "How do I add a new building?" | Buildings & Units |
| "What are the ledger statuses?" | Payments |
| "When can a tenant renew their contract?" | Renewals |
| "What does UNKNOWN occupancy mean?" | Bookings & Occupancy |
| "What permissions does the support role have?" | Roles & Permissions |

### Understanding Responses

Each response includes:
- **Text**: The direct answer to your question
- **Sources**: Links to relevant Knowledge Base pages so you can verify and read in detail

### Tips for Better Answers

1. **Be specific**: Instead of "How does payment work?", ask "What are the steps to handle a failed payment?"
2. **Provide context**: If your question is about a specific scenario, describe it. Example: "What should I do if a Beds24-linked unit tenant wants to extend?"
3. **One question at a time**: Do not combine multiple questions in a single message
